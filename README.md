The random sentence generator is just for fun! These sentences can provide humour and be coll way to surprise other by sharing a standout sentence on social media platforms and gathering your network's reaction.



**Solution**


The Generator is based on the following model:
*[Sentence] = 'who' + 'Action' + 'Details'
   **Who** = 'Name' | 'Name' from 'Place'
   
              *Names = {Peter, Michaell, Jane, Stave)
              *Places = {Sofia, London. New York, Germany...}

  **Action** = 'Verb' + 'Noun' | 'Adverbs' + 'Verb' + 'Noun'

            *Verbs = {eats, holds, sees, plays with, brings)
            *Nouns = {stones, cakes, apples, laptops, bikes}
            *Adverbs = {slowly, diligently, warmly, sadly, rapidly}

**Details** = {near the river, at home, in the park}
